In this repository, you will find implementations of a non-uniform quantizer using the Lloyd-max algorithm and Adaptive Delta Modulation. 
You will also find an example that produces various results regarding the output of these two algorithms with an auto-regressive random process as their input. 
This project was assigned by the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of the University of Patras where I'm currently an undergraduate student.
