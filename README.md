In this repository, you will find an implementation of a non-uniform quantizer using the Lloyd-max algorithm as well as an implementation for Adaptive Delta Modulation. 
This project was assigned by the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of the University of Patras where I'm currently an undergraduate student.
